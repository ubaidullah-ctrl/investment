I've created a basic framework for market simulation with several key components:

Core Models (market_sim/core/models/base.py):
Order, Trade, and Position management
Order book implementation
Asset definitions

Market Components (market_sim/market/):
Matching Engine for order execution
Base Agent class for trading strategies
Market Making implementation

Simulation Engine (market_sim/simulation/):
Time management
Event processing
Metrics collection
Market event handling

Sample Scenario (market_sim/simulation/scenarios/):
Market making scenario with random traders
Price shocks and volatility changes
Basic statistics collection

The framework is designed to be extensible for your requirements:

Trading Strategies:
Extend BaseAgent for new strategies
Implement HFT strategies in strategies/hft/
Add ML-based strategies in strategies/ml/

Market Mechanisms:
Add options/warrants in market/mechanisms/
Implement margin trading
Add short selling capabilities

Blockchain Integration:
Add Ethereum integration in blockchain/ethereum/
Implement consensus mechanisms
Create smart contracts for trading

User Interfaces:
Web interface for visualization
CLI for quick testing
Desktop app for detailed analysis

Next steps could include:

Implementing more sophisticated trading strategies:
Statistical arbitrage
Options market making
ML-based prediction models

Adding market microstructure features:
Latency simulation
Order types (IOC, FOK, etc.)
Fee models

Enhancing the simulation engine:
Multi-threading support
Real-time visualization
More market events

Creating learning scenarios:
Tutorial simulations
Strategy backtesting
Risk management exercises
